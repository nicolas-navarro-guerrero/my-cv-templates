## The symbol font MARVOSYM.TTF
### Useful symbols for the office
In almost every True Type symbol collection there are dozens of arrows and snowflakes. Why isn't there any symbol for an answering machine? Why can't you find a "corresponds to" sign in any math font? Do you really have to purchase a new office software package just for the Euro currency symbol? What about engineering symbols like load, beam or support? I finally decided to design my own symbol font which includes all those missing and badly needed symbols.
